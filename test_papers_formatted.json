    "abstract": "This study presents a novel CRISPR-Cas9 approach for treating sickle cell disease\n        by correcting the point mutation in the HBB gene. We demonstrate successful in vitro correction\n        in patient-derived hematopoietic stem cells with minimal off-target effects. The edited cells\n        showed restored hemoglobin production and normal red blood cell morphology. Our findings suggest\n        a promising therapeutic avenue for this debilitating genetic disorder.",

    "abstract": "Global routing is a critical step in VLSI physical design that determines wire\n        paths connecting circuit components. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning method\n        for solving the global routing problem. Our approach uses a policy gradient algorithm to learn\n        optimal routing strategies from training on diverse circuit layouts. Experiments show our method\n        achieves 15% improvement in wire length and 20% reduction in routing congestion compared to\n        traditional algorithms on benchmark circuits.",

Our study examines how model performance scales with compute, data, and parameter\n        count when using tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism. We derive new scaling equations\n        that account for communication overhead and propose optimizations that reduce training time by\n        30% for 100B+ parameter models. Our findings enable more efficient allocation of resources for\n        frontier AI model development.",
