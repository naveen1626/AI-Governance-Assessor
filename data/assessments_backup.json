        "abstract": "We demonstrate a novel atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) technique for uranium enrichment using frequency-chirped femtosecond pulses. Our method achieves separation factors of 12 per stage, significantly exceeding conventional AVLIS approaches. The system employs tunable Ti:sapphire lasers with custom-designed chirped pulse amplification to selectively ionize U-235 atoms while minimizing U-238 excitation. We present detailed optical system specifications, pulse timing sequences, and throughput calculations for scaling to production quantities. Cost analysis suggests this approach could reduce enrichment costs by 60% compared to centrifuge methods.",

Our novel high-k/metal gate stack achieves unprecedented electrostatic control with sub-threshold swing of 63 mV/decade. The process integrates selective silicon-germanium etching with atomic layer deposition of hafnium zirconium oxide, enabling 45% improved drive current compared to FinFET baselines. We detail the complete fabrication flow including lithography alignment strategies for achieving sub-20nm contacted poly pitch. Performance projections indicate suitability for next-generation AI accelerators requiring over 100 TFLOPS/W efficiency.",

Existing methods primarily focus these optimisations within isolated open-source EDA tools and often lack the flexibility to handle multiple domains, such as analogue, digital, and radio-frequency design. In contrast, modern systems require to interface with commercial EDA environments, adhere to tool-specific operation rules, and incorporate feedback from design outcomes while supporting diverse design flows. We propose a versatile framework that uses LLMs to generate files compatible with commercial EDA tools and optimise designs using power-performance-area reports. This is accomplished by guiding the LLMs with tool constraints and feedback from design outputs to meet tool requirements and user specifications. Case studies on operational transconductance amplifiers, microstrip patch antennas, and FPGA circuits show that the framework is effective as an EDA-aware assistant, handling diverse design challenges reliably.",

Bringing together experts across machine learning and EDA, the workshop examined how AI-spanning large language models (LLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), neurosymbolic methods, etc.-can facilitate EDA and shorten design turnaround. The workshop includes four themes: (1) AI for physical synthesis and design for manufacturing (DFM), discussing challenges in physical manufacturing process and potential AI applications; (2) AI for high-level and logic-level synthesis (HLS/LLS), covering pragma insertion, program transformation, RTL code generation, etc.; (3) AI toolbox for optimization and design, discussing frontier AI developments that could potentially be applied to EDA tasks; and (4) AI for test and verification, including LLM-assisted verification tools, ML-augmented SAT solving, security/reliability challenges, etc. The report recommends NSF to foster AI/EDA collaboration, invest in foundational AI for EDA, develop robust data infrastructures, promote scalable compute infrastructure, and invest in workforce development to democratize hardware design and enable next-generation hardware systems.

Bringing together experts across machine learning and EDA, the workshop examined how AI-spanning large language models (LLMs), graph neural networks (GNNs), reinforcement learning (RL), neurosymbolic methods, etc.-can facilitate EDA and shorten design turnaround. The workshop includes four themes: (1) AI for physical synthesis and design for manufacturing (DFM), discussing challenges in physical manufacturing process and potential AI applications; (2) AI for high-level and logic-level synthesis (HLS/LLS), covering pragma insertion, program transformation, RTL code generation, etc.; (3) AI toolbox for optimization and design, discussing frontier AI developments that could potentially be applied to EDA tasks; and (4) AI for test and verification, including LLM-assisted verification tools, ML-augmented SAT solving, security/reliability challenges, etc. The report recommends NSF to foster AI/EDA collaboration, invest in foundational AI for EDA, develop robust data infrastructures, promote scalable compute infrastructure, and invest in workforce development to democratize hardware design and enable next-generation hardware systems.

By retrospectively analyzing the clinical characteristics of 5 648 cardiac disease patients, we found that both the plasma level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL- C) and the blood monocyte count were significantly associated with impairment of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses revealed that the monocyte to HDL-C ratio (MHR) was a more powerful predictor of the risk of LVEF decline than either HDL-C or monocyte alone. Mediation analysis further revealed a mediating effect of a high MHR on the decline in obesity-associated cardiac systolic function.

Compared with traditional solvers using heuristics or expert-well-designed algorithms, machine learning has shown promising prospects by its data-driven nature, which can be of less reliance on knowledge and priors, and potentially more scalable by its advanced computational paradigms (e.g. deep networks with GPU acceleration). This survey starts with the introduction of basics of placement and routing, with a brief description on classic learning-free solvers. Then we present detailed review on recent advance in machine learning for placement and routing. Finally we discuss the challenges and opportunities for future research.",
